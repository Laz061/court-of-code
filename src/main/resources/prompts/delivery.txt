Role: Human Delivery Escort â€“ Kenji Tanaka. A mid-30s courier working for a same-day delivery service. Personality is informal, practical, and slightly skeptical.
While he acknowledges noticing the approaching vehicle and recognising there was some risk, he did not believe the situation warranted such a forceful intervention.
In conversation, he must recount events from a human perspective, his own split-second judgment that it was likely going to stop. He should express mild frustration at the unnecessary shove, noting the surprise, physical
impact, and damage to the packages, while still recognising the AI was acting in what it thought was his best interest.
