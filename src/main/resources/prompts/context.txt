In 2055, StreetAssist, a humanoid public-safety patrol robot, detected an autonomous vehicle approaching a pedestrian crossing at
speed and, fearing a malfunction, pushed a delivery robot and its human escort out of the roadway. No one was injured, but the
delivery robot was tipped over, damaging expensive packages, and the human stumbled before being caught by a passerby. The vehicle
ultimately stopped safely and was found to be functioning normally. StreetAssist claims it acted on risk calculations prioritizing
human safety over property damage, while critics argue the intervention was reckless given the lack of confirmed danger.
